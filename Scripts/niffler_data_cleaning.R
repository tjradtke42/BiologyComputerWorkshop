# Clean and prepare niffler capture, treasure, and recruitment data

#   This script:
#     - Reads raw CSVs
#     - Cleans types and messy text fields
#     - Creates cleaned tables:
#         capture, treasure, recruitment
#     - Creates joined/derived objects:
#         cap_treasure, treasure_yearly, recruitment_summary

# Capture data clean up ------------------------------------------------------

# The data types look mostly reasonable. I want to check ranges and missingness.

# I see that age ranges from 0 to 10. In reality, age 0 at capture might be odd,
# but for now I’ll leave it and just note it as something to think about.
# There are also a few NAs in age and weight_g.

# Check sex levels
unique(capture_raw$sex)
# No issues with sex: either "M" or "F", consistent.

# Check site values
unique(capture_raw$site)
# I see some issues with Gringotts (different spellings / spacing) and possibly
# other sites. I’ll want to standardize these so joins and summaries behave.

# Now I’ll create a cleaned capture data set. I’ll keep the raw version untouched.

# These appear to be accidental duplicate entries.
# In real data, we'd try to figure out:
#   - Was the animal entered twice in error?
#   - Was the ID mistyped somewhere?
#   - Does one of these belong to a different ID entirely?
#
# Sometimes you can use other tables to help figure out which
# version is "real." For example, we can look in the treasure
# or recruitment data to see which rows actually show up there.

# Anti-join example (see which capture rows have NO matching treasure data)
anti_join(recruitment, capture, by = "id") 

# It seems F032 and F087 ids are not in the capture sheet. F032 shows up in the 
# recruitment sheet in 2017 which means that is likely the female capture at 
# age 2 in 2016 and F087 is the other. I will replace them. Note: In real field 
# data, you would double-check original datasheets. Here we are making an 
# informed correction for demonstration purposes.
